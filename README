IMPORTANT
=========

This is just a _wrapper_ around the driver written by datastax.

The datastax driver makes _blocking calls_ to the database.

Therefore, this lua wrapper _may block the event loop_ of event-driven
systems, such as nginx.

Build
=====

Install the C/C++ datastax cassandra driver. Use tag 2.3.0.

mkdir /path/to/build/tree
cd /path/to/build/tree
# on multiarch amd64:
cmake /path/to/source/tree
make

Install
=======

cd /path/to/build/tree
make install

"make install" will install
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblua5.1-cassandra-driver.so
and make the symlink
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lua/5.1/db/cassandra.so
point to it

How to use
==========

Check src/unit/testDriver for an example.
